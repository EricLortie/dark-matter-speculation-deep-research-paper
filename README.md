# Dark matter is mass from adjacent pancakes in an infinite stack of reality pancakes

## Abstract  
Dark matter remains one of the most compelling mysteries in cosmology, traditionally attributed to unknown particles or modifications of gravity. This paper explores an alternative interpretation inspired by brane cosmology and multiverse frameworks – the idea that dark matter is the gravitational influence of ordinary mass residing in **adjacent "reality pancakes"**, i.e. parallel universes or branes stacked in a higher-dimensional space. We review how brane-world models allow gravity to "leak" between dimensional layers, enabling matter in one brane to affect another gravitationally ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)) ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=attractive%20power%20,4)). This theoretical framing is contrasted with established dark matter paradigms, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and modified gravity (MOND). We discuss the consistency of the "reality pancake" model with astrophysical observations – such as galaxy rotation curves and the Bullet Cluster – and identify how it fits within or challenges the $\Lambda$CDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) paradigm. While highly speculative, this concept provides an intriguing higher-dimensional explanation for dark matter, highlighting connections to string theory, brane cosmology, and multiverse ideas. We distinguish clearly between well-supported theory and conjecture, and suggest ways future experiments or observations might test the idea of dark matter as interdimensional mass.

## Introduction  
Astrophysical and cosmological observations overwhelmingly indicate that the vast majority of matter in the Universe is **dark** – interacting via gravity but invisible via electromagnetic radiation. Evidence for this dark matter (DM) includes the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, and the cosmic microwave background anisotropies, all of which point to an unseen mass component comprising about 25–27% of the energy density of the Universe ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=,the%20dominant%20baryonic%20mass%20component)) ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=but%20rather%20approximately%20traces%20the,in%20the%20system%20is%20unseen)). In galaxy clusters, for example, X-ray observations of hot gas and gravitational lensing maps show that most of the mass (inferred from lensing) is offset from the normal baryonic matter, strongly suggesting a dominant unseen matter component ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=collision,matter%20in%20the%20cluster%2C%20is)) ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=astronomers%20find%20most%20of%20the,The)). 

 ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094)) **Figure 1:** Composite image of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657–558) showing separated distributions of visible matter and total gravitational mass. Hot gas (pink, X-ray image) contains the bulk of the ordinary baryonic matter, while the blue regions indicate the cluster's mass as traced by gravitational lensing. The lensing mass peaks (blue) are clearly displaced from the gas, providing direct empirical proof that most of the matter is invisible dark matter ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=collision,matter%20in%20the%20cluster%2C%20is)). This observation cannot be explained by modifying gravity alone, but is consistent with a collisionless dark matter component that interacts only via gravity ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=,the%20dominant%20baryonic%20mass%20component)) ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=but%20rather%20approximately%20traces%20the,in%20the%20system%20is%20unseen)).

The nature of dark matter remains unknown. The **dominant paradigm** has long been that dark matter consists of one or more species of non-baryonic particles. WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) – arising in theories beyond the Standard Model such as supersymmetry – were a leading candidate for decades. These hypothetical particles would have masses on the order of 10–1000 GeV and interact via at most the weak nuclear force, making them invisible to electromagnetic observations yet able to produce the required gravitational effects. Another well-motivated candidate is the **axion**, an ultra-light ($\mu$eV to meV-scale) boson originally proposed to solve the strong-CP problem in quantum chromodynamics; axions could form a cosmic Bose–Einstein condensate or otherwise behave as cold dark matter on large scales. Intensive experimental efforts have been undertaken to detect WIMPs (e.g. in underground direct-detection experiments and at the Large Hadron Collider) and axions (e.g. via microwave cavity haloscopes), but so far *no conclusive signal has been found* – WIMPs and axions remain hypothetical ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=,Cacciapaglia%20said)) ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=presence%2C)). This lack of detection has prompted consideration of more exotic possibilities, ranging from heavier primordial black holes to entire hidden sectors of particles that communicate with our ordinary matter only through gravity.

Alongside particle explanations, **modified gravity** theories have been proposed to eliminate the need for dark matter. The most prominent is MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) and its relativistic extensions, which postulate that the laws of gravity deviate from Newton/Einstein predictions at very low accelerations (on the order of $10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$). MOND can explain individual galaxy rotation curves by effectively strengthening gravity in regimes of low acceleration, but it faces challenges at larger scales. Galaxy clusters and colliding clusters (like the Bullet Cluster in **Figure 1**) show gravitational effects that MOND alone cannot account for ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=the%20fluid,in%20the%20system%20is%20unseen)). Moreover, the $\Lambda$CDM model with dark matter provides an excellent fit to cosmological data such as the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and large-scale structure, whereas MOND would require fine-tuned additional components to fit these observations. Thus, **the default interpretation is that dark matter is a real form of matter or energy** rather than a misunderstanding of gravity.

In this context, we explore a **novel and speculative framework** for dark matter: the idea that what we call “dark matter” might actually be the gravitational influence of ordinary matter residing in other universes or other layers of reality – metaphorically, **mass from adjacent pancakes in an infinite stack of reality pancakes**. In modern theoretical physics language, one can interpret these "reality pancakes" as parallel 3+1-dimensional universes (branes) embedded in a higher-dimensional space (the bulk). Our Universe would be one "pancake" (one brane) in this stack, and other pancakes represent separate universes offset in an extra spatial dimension. While particles and forces like electromagnetism might be confined to each individual "pancake," gravity could extend through the higher-dimensional bulk and thereby mediate interactions between branes ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)) ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=nuclear%20force%20%20are%20localized,4)). If so, **matter in a neighboring brane** would be invisible to us (no electromagnetic or strong/weak nuclear interactions across branes), yet its gravity could pull on objects in our universe. To an observer in our brane, this would appear exactly like the effect of dark matter: extra gravitational acceleration from an unseen source. This paper will develop this concept within the frameworks of brane cosmology and multiverse theories, review its theoretical plausibility, and compare it with other dark matter paradigms. In doing so, we distinguish established results (e.g. standard cosmological observations, well-tested brane models) from speculative extrapolations (the "reality pancake" hypothesis itself), aiming for a rigorous yet open-minded examination of this unconventional idea.

## Methodology and Theoretical Framework  
### Brane Cosmology and Higher-Dimensional “Pancakes”  
In string theory and related high-energy theories, our visible four-dimensional universe (three spatial dimensions + time) might be a surface or membrane – a **brane** – floating in a higher-dimensional space called the **bulk** ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Animation%20showing%20multiple%20brane%20universes,in%20the%20bulk)). In such brane-world models, all familiar Standard Model particles and forces are typically confined to move on the brane, but gravity (carried by the spin-2 graviton) is associated with the geometry of spacetime itself and can propagate in the extra dimension(s) of the bulk ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)). This offers an explanation for why gravity is so weak compared to other forces: it **"leaks"** out of our brane into the extra dimensions, diluting its apparent strength on the brane ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=nuclear%20force%20%20are%20localized,4)). The classic examples are the Randall–Sundrum models and Large Extra Dimension models, which show how gravitational flux in higher dimensions can address puzzles like the hierarchy problem and potentially be observed via deviations from Newton’s inverse-square law at sub-millimeter scales ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)) ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=and%20propagates%20on%20the%20full,4)).

Importantly, brane cosmology implies that **other branes (parallel universes) can coexist in the bulk alongside our own** ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=The%20central%20idea%20is%20that,in%20more%20standard%20cosmological%20models)). One can imagine each brane as a separate "layer" of reality – hence the **"stack of pancakes" metaphor** – with perhaps a small gap in the extra dimension separating each neighboring universe. These branes might be infinite in extent (if the extra dimension is non-compact or only warped) or they could be arranged along a compact extra dimension (like points on a circle, for example). In either case, if two branes are sufficiently close in the bulk, their only significant interaction would be gravitational (assuming no other inter-brane forces). The central hypothesis we investigate is that **matter on these hidden branes manifests as dark matter in our own**. We never see or touch that matter directly, but we feel its gravity. As Hongya Liu described in an early exploration of this idea, *“although one cannot see a particle which is confined to another brane, one can feel its gravity explicitly as if it were located on our brane”* ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=,It%20is%20shown%20that)). In effect, matter on all branes contributes to the curvature of spacetime in our brane; dark matter *“is probably nothing unusual but a ‘shadow’ cast on our brane by hidden ordinary matter of other branes.”* ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=although%20one%20can%20not%20see,implying%20that)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=omega%20is%20a%20positive%20r,and%20implications%20are%20also%20discussed)). 

For this scenario to quantitatively explain the **dark matter phenomenon**, the cumulative gravitational influence of matter in other branes must account for the observed dark matter effects in our universe. If there are many such branes ("an infinite stack of pancakes" in the idealized limit), and each carries a roughly similar mass distribution to our own, the total gravity from all those hidden masses could mimic the presence of a large dark matter component ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=omega%20is%20a%20positive%20r,and%20implications%20are%20also%20discussed)). In Liu’s calculation, a simple model with an extra dimension compactified on a circle showed that a point mass on a “hidden” brane could produce nearly the same gravitational field on our brane as if that mass were here ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=,It%20is%20shown%20that)). Thus, a collection of masses across multiple branes would act like an additional source of gravity in our 4D universe, effectively behaving as dark matter. The dark matter halos around galaxies, in this picture, could be interpreted as **effective halos** formed by ordinary stars and gas on other branes that are gravitationally bound to the same potential wells as our galaxy ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=several%20branes%2C%20the%20total%20amount,and%20implications%20are%20also%20discussed)). Those hidden stars orbiting in a neighboring universe would produce the extra gravitational pull on our galaxy, holding its rotation curve flat at large radii just as conventional dark matter would. Notably, they would be **collisionless** with respect to our baryonic gas and stars – exactly a key property inferred for dark matter from observations like the Bullet Cluster (the unseen mass does not interact via fluid pressure or drag with ordinary gas) ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=the%20distant%20objects%20is%20distorted,except%20through%20gravity%2C%20and%20separates)) ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=the%20clusters%20,separates%20from%20the%20normal%20matter)).

The concept of **gravity-mediated parallel universes** has been explored in various theoretical studies. For example, van de Bruck and Teixeira (2020) developed a *“dark D-brane”* cosmology scenario in which dark matter is literally matter on a D-brane moving in a higher-dimensional space, and by construction it interacts with the Standard Model only via gravity ([[2007.15414] Dark D-Brane Cosmology: from background evolution to cosmological perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15414#:~:text=,in%20which%20the%20coupling%20is)). They associate a dynamical field (a modulus of brane position) with dark energy, while matter on the brane provides dark matter, and they show how cosmic expansion and perturbation growth would proceed in such a model ([[2007.15414] Dark D-Brane Cosmology: from background evolution to cosmological perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15414#:~:text=present,with%20other%20disformal%20quintessence%20models)). Other works have considered hidden branes endowed with copies of the Standard Model as a way to generate dark matter candidates. As Stasser and Sarrazin (2020) note, *“Many works, aiming to explain the origin of dark matter or dark energy, consider the existence of hidden (brane)worlds parallel to our own visible world… Hidden braneworlds allow for hidden copies of the Standard Model. For instance, atoms hidden in a hidden brane could exist as dark matter candidates.”* ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=,)) ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=Many%20works%2C%20aiming%20to%20explain,way%20to%20constrain%20such%20hypotheses)). In other words, an ordinary hydrogen atom on a hidden brane would feel just like a dark matter particle to us: it has mass and gravity, but we cannot see its electromagnetic radiation or other Standard Model interactions.

It is worth contrasting this *brane-world multiverse* picture with another multiverse concept: the idea of separate, non-communicating bubble universes (as in eternal inflation). In a traditional inflationary multiverse, different universes do not interact at all after their formation – thus matter in those universes has no effect on ours. The **“reality pancakes” scenario is fundamentally different** because the parallel universes (branes) are not completely disconnected; they reside in a shared higher-dimensional space allowing a specific coupling (gravity) between them. This is a crucial aspect: only with some form of inter-universe interaction can the presence of other universes be relevant for our observable physics. Brane-world setups naturally provide such an interaction channel through gravity. As long as the branes are separated by a finite distance in the bulk that is not too large, the gravitational field of a mass on one brane can reach another. In many models, the gravitational influence might drop off with the separation in the extra dimension, but if the separation is small or the bulk geometry is curved (warped) in certain ways, the effect can be significant ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=one%20side%20of%20the%20circle,fluid%20could%20serve%20as%20a)). Some scenarios (e.g. with a compact extra dimension of radius $R$) even imply an infinite series of "image" masses – essentially, the gravitational field of a mass repeats periodically across branes – which can bolster the influence on our brane ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=,It%20is%20shown%20that)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=cast%20on%20our%20brane%20by,distribution%20yielded%20by%20hidden%20ordinary)). 

 ([NASA SVS | Brane Theory of Multiple Dimensions](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10137)) **Figure 2:** **Brane-world universe concept (“Reality Pancakes”).** Illustration of a higher-dimensional bulk containing multiple 3D branes (depicted as colored planes or "pancake" slices). Our observable universe is one such brane (one layer in the stack). If gravity (represented by the grid curvature) propagates through the extra dimension, matter on a neighboring brane can exert gravitational force on our brane ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=The%20central%20idea%20is%20that,in%20more%20standard%20cosmological%20models)) ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=no%20reference%20to%20the%20bulk,in%20more%20standard%20cosmological%20models)). In this metaphor, dark matter in our universe could be the gravitational effect of normal matter (e.g. stars, gas, or even entire galaxies) residing on those adjacent branes. No other forces can penetrate the bulk, so the matter on other branes is invisible and undetectable to us except through gravity.

### Conceptual Model and Assumptions  
To proceed, we outline the conceptual model in simplified terms. We assume an **infinite or very large stack of brane-universes** parallel to our own. Each brane has similar physical laws (for instance, each could have its own copy of Standard Model physics confined to that brane). We live on one brane (call it Brane 0). Adjacent to us are Brane +1 and Brane –1 (the “pancakes” immediately above and below ours in the extra dimension), and further out are Brane +2, Brane –2, and so on. For mathematical simplicity, one might imagine the extra dimension to be compact (like a circle or orbifold) so that the branes repeat periodically, or it could be infinite with branes distributed throughout. The critical assumption is that **gravity from any brane can influence the others**. In a realistic model, the strength of this influence may decline with the distance between branes. If the branes are evenly spaced and the spacing is small, the nearest neighbors might have the strongest effect. In an *infinite* stack, one must consider how to avoid an infinite cumulative gravity – possible resolutions include branes of diminishing matter content, an increasing separation, or a warp factor that suppresses distant interactions (as in Randall–Sundrum's exponentially warped metric).

Under this setup, consider a galaxy on our brane (Brane 0). It consists of stars and gas (visible matter) which we can observe. Now assume that on Brane +1 (our nearest neighbor brane), there is also a galaxy (perhaps an ordinary galaxy in that universe) located in the corresponding region of space. The Brane +1 galaxy’s stars are invisible to us, but their gravity crosses over. If the two branes are almost “on top of each other” in the bulk (separated by a tiny distance), the gravitational field of the Brane +1 galaxy will affect objects in our galaxy almost as strongly as if those stars were in our own brane ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=,It%20is%20shown%20that)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=although%20one%20can%20not%20see,implying%20that)). The same holds for Brane –1, Brane +2, etc. Thus, our galaxy on Brane 0 might be surrounded by a **halo of gravitational influence** from galaxies on other branes, which we interpret as a dark matter halo. Meanwhile, from the perspective of an observer on Brane +1, our galaxy’s matter would act as their dark matter halo. In a symmetric multi-brane setup, each universe sees the others’ matter as dark matter – a reciprocal “shadow matter” effect.

To make this quantitative, one would sum the gravitational contributions from all hidden branes. If $N_{\text{brane}}$ is the number of other branes that contribute significantly, and each has matter roughly distributed like ours, then the effective dark matter density in our brane would be roughly $N_{\text{brane}}$ times the average matter density of one other brane (modulated by any inter-brane coupling factor). In an infinite stack, $N_{\text{brane}}$ could be very large; however, the coupling may diminish for far-separated branes, effectively limiting the sum. For example, Liu’s study considered an extra dimension compactified on a circle, where a mass on the opposite side of the circle still exerted nearly full-strength gravity ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=,It%20is%20shown%20that)) – in that ideal case, many mirror masses would *each* contribute, leading to an amplification. More detailed work would be needed to avoid over-counting and to ensure consistency with gravitational theory (uncontrolled infinite contributions could be problematic). For our purposes, we assume it is possible to have parameters such that the **total hidden mass influence accounts for the required dark matter fraction (~85% of matter is dark)** in our Universe ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=omega%20is%20a%20positive%20r,and%20implications%20are%20also%20discussed)). This is not implausible if, say, there are of order 5–6 other branes with similar matter content: then for each visible matter particle we have several shadow particles’ worth of gravitational pull, making dark matter roughly five times more abundant than visible matter (consistent with observations). 

It should be noted that this framework does *not* require that the other branes have identical physics or matter content to ours, only that they have sufficient total mass in structures that overlap our structures gravitationally. They could even be largely dark to their own inhabitants (for instance, one brane might be mostly filled with dark, non-luminous matter or black holes) – but for simplicity, many authors assume hidden branes might host copies of baryonic matter ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=Many%20works%2C%20aiming%20to%20explain,way%20to%20constrain%20such%20hypotheses)). If the other branes had much *more* mass than ours, their gravity would dominate and we would measure a dark matter fraction higher than observed; if they had much less, they wouldn’t fully explain dark matter. So a rough correspondence in matter content is often assumed for the concept to work cleanly.

Another assumption we make is that **non-gravitational interactions between branes are negligible**. This is supported by brane-world constructions in string theory – standard model forces are typically carried by open strings ending on a brane and cannot travel into the bulk or onto another brane. Only the closed-string modes (like the graviton, and possibly other exotic bulk fields like a dilaton or moduli) can mediate between branes ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)). This ensures that hidden brane matter is truly invisible (dark) to us except for gravity. It also prevents catastrophic effects like proton decay or large missing energy loss into the extra dimension, which would occur if particles could freely move between branes. There is a possibility of extremely feeble interactions (for example, some models consider that a particle like the neutron might have a tiny probability to oscillate into a hidden braneworld state ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=Can%20neutron%20disappearance%2Freappearance%20experiments%20definitively,copy%20of%20the%20Standard%20Model)) ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=Many%20works%2C%20aiming%20to%20explain,coupling%20g%20can%20be%20constrained))). Experimental tests have been proposed to detect such phenomena, e.g. "neutron disappearance and reappearance" experiments that attempt to catch neutrons vanishing into, or reappearing from, another brane as a direct evidence of a parallel world coupling ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=Can%20neutron%20disappearance%2Freappearance%20experiments%20definitively,copy%20of%20the%20Standard%20Model)) ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=,45)). So far, no definitive evidence of such events has been found, allowing any inter-brane coupling (besides gravity) to be extremely small.

Given this theoretical framework, we can now analyze how well the "mass from adjacent reality pancakes" idea fits known data and how it compares to other explanations of dark matter. We will consider both **astrophysical phenomenology** (does having hidden brane matter reproduce the observational successes of dark matter in $\Lambda$CDM?) and **particle physics/cosmology aspects** (does it solve or sidestep issues that WIMPs/axions/MOND face, and what new challenges does it introduce?).

## Analysis and Discussion  
### Consistency with Astrophysical Observations  
Any viable explanation of dark matter must account for the wide range of evidence at galactic and cosmological scales. The brane-world multiverse scenario, interestingly, reproduces many aspects of the phenomenological behavior of cold dark matter by construction, while also making distinctive predictions.

**Galaxy Rotation Curves & Halos:** In our scenario, the rotation of stars in a galaxy is influenced by the gravity of both visible stars (on Brane 0) *and* the shadow stars on neighboring branes. This effectively yields a flat rotation curve at large radii if the shadow matter is distributed in an extended halo around the galaxy (as expected since the other branes’ galaxies would be similarly extended). Because the hidden matter does not dissipate energy into radiation on our brane, it can form a dynamically hot halo (like standard collisionless DM) rather than sinking to the center. Thus the successful explanation of galaxy rotation curves by cold dark matter halos can be mirrored by this model. The difference is purely interpretational: what we call a “dark matter halo” is actually the superposition of many invisible twin galaxies. As long as the mass profiles in the other branes roughly follow a Navarro-Frenk-White or similar distribution (which would emerge naturally if structure formation occurs similarly in those branes), the detailed fits to rotation curve data would be as good as in $\Lambda$CDM. The **observed stability of galactic disks** and the inferred presence of massive, spherical halos are automatically satisfied, since gravity from other-brane matter behaves exactly like gravity from in-brane dark matter. 

A subtle point is whether the presence of multiple interacting (gravitationally interacting, that is) copies of a galaxy across branes could lead to dynamical differences. One might worry about interactions such as dynamical friction between the halos on different branes. However, because the interaction is only gravitational and relatively weak (each brane’s matter moves in its own space), the effect should mimic the collisionless DM case. For instance, two galaxies merging on our brane will experience dynamical friction mostly due to their own dark matter halo (which is partly our brane’s and partly others, but all contributing to the combined potential). The hidden brane halos will merge with their counterpart galaxies on those branes. Effectively, each brane sees a merger with dark matter involved. There could be slight phase lags or offsets if, say, the hidden matter halos are not perfectly coincident spatially with our halo during interactions, but in a symmetric setup they likely would track each other because the gravitational potential well is shared. Detailed N-body simulations would be needed to quantify this, but qualitatively the behavior can align with conventional expectations for dark matter.

**Galaxy Clusters and Collisions:** As highlighted by **Figure 1** with the Bullet Cluster, one of the key pieces of evidence for dark matter is that in collisions of galaxy clusters, the mass (as seen by gravitational lensing) stays with the galaxies and not with the colliding gas ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=the%20distant%20objects%20is%20distorted,except%20through%20gravity%2C%20and%20separates)). In our model, consider two clusters on Brane 0 that pass through each other. The gas in those clusters (baryonic matter) collides and slows down, forming the pink X-ray shock we observe. But what about the hidden-brane matter? Each cluster on Brane 0 is accompanied by cluster-sized distributions of matter on Brane ±1, ±2, etc. When the Brane 0 clusters collide, the Brane ±1 clusters do not directly collide with the gas – they are on their own branes, where presumably a similar encounter might be happening if the two cluster regions overlap in space. The crucial point is that **the hidden-brane dark matter does not experience fluid pressure or drag with our brane’s gas**, so from our perspective it behaves just like collisionless dark matter. The outcome would be that the center of mass of the gravitational potential (dominated by the sum of our cluster’s dark matter and the parallel clusters’ matter) will move ahead of the gas. The stars in our brane’s clusters are also collisionless and move ahead, aligned with where the gravitational potential ends up (mostly unaffected by the gas). Thus, a lensing observer sees the mass distribution (blue in Fig. 1) displaced from the gas (pink), exactly as observed ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=collision,matter%20in%20the%20cluster%2C%20is)) ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=the%20distant%20objects%20is%20distorted,impact%2C%20because%20it%20does%20not)). The hidden clusters on other branes basically pile up in the same area as our clusters’ dark matter halo would, and since they don’t stick to the gas, they emerge separated after the collision. In effect, the "reality pancakes" model naturally preserves the explanation of the Bullet Cluster: dark matter is collisionless because it resides out-of-brane.

**Large-Scale Structure and CMB:** The $\Lambda$CDM model with cold dark matter has been very successful in explaining the statistical properties of large-scale structure (the distribution of galaxies and clusters) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. Any alternate theory must either reproduce those or at least not contradict them. A priori, one might expect the brane-world dark matter to mimic cold dark matter in these regards, because gravitational instability would operate similarly. In the early universe, before recombination, dark matter began clumping under gravity, seeding the formation of galaxies. In our scenario, the other branes’ matter would also clump; however, an interesting twist is that **the gravitational wells are sourced by the combined mass of all branes**. This could potentially enhance structure formation: effectively there are more sources for the same gravitational potential. Researchers have begun to study such effects. For example, van de Bruck & Teixeira (2020) derived the equations for linear perturbation growth in the dark D-brane model and computed CMB anisotropy and matter power spectra to compare with observations ([[2007.15414] Dark D-Brane Cosmology: from background evolution to cosmological perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15414#:~:text=present,with%20other%20disformal%20quintessence%20models)). They found that by adjusting parameters (such as the coupling of the D-brane’s position to matter), one can produce results in line with current data. The presence of multiple matter components (each on different branes but all gravitating together) might be reinterpreted as a single effective dark matter component in the Friedmann equations, so the background evolution and perturbation growth can be similar to standard cosmology, as long as the effective density and equation of state match cold dark matter. One potential difference is if there are relative motions between branes or if the inter-brane distance changes with time (which could act like a form of dark energy or could alter the growth rate slightly). In the simplest case where branes are static and fixed in the bulk, and all have similar matter fractions, one would effectively just have a larger $Ω_{\rm m}$ (matter density) due to the multiple layers of matter, but since we already count that as dark matter in our measured $Ω_{\rm m}$, it presents no contradiction. The CMB acoustic peaks require a certain amount of matter (dark+visible) versus radiation and baryons to fit correctly; as long as the total gravitational matter is the same, the CMB doesn’t care if some resides in other dimensions. There could be subtle effects on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or other second-order perturbations if, for instance, energy transfer between branes occurred, but our assumption is that only gravity links them, which is a very weak coupling that should conserve energy on each brane separately to a good approximation.

**Summary of Phenomenology:** In broad strokes, the **“mass from adjacent branes” behaves like cold dark matter**: it clusters, forms halos, influences orbits, and doesn’t collide or radiate. This is a significant strength of the model – it is largely indistinguishable from ordinary dark matter in terms of fitting existing data, provided the setup is symmetric and stable. The differences are more conceptual and would emerge in contexts beyond the standard paradigm, which leads us to consider how we might test or distinguish this scenario.

### Challenges and Theoretical Implications  
While the idea of dark matter as hidden brane matter is appealing in that it leverages known theoretical frameworks, it also raises several challenges and open questions:

- **Testability:** One of the most pointed criticisms of this scenario is that it can become almost untestable by design. If dark matter resides entirely in other branes, then **all non-gravitational avenues to detect dark matter will fail**, as indeed they have so far. This aligns with the current experimental situation – no WIMP or axion detection – but it also means the theory could be accused of being a deus ex machina: adding unobservable universes to explain an unobservable form of matter. The obvious way to test it would be through gravity itself. Precision tests of gravity at various scales might reveal subtle deviations or effects consistent with inter-brane interactions. For example, the existence of multiple branes could, in some models, lead to a very small correction to Newton’s law (e.g., a $1/r^2$ potential plus tiny $1/r^n$ terms from Kaluza-Klein modes). Experiments looking for fifth forces or deviations at sub-millimeter scales constrain such effects and thus indirectly constrain how large the brane separation or coupling can be ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=and%20propagates%20on%20the%20full,4)). So far, no deviation has been seen down to tens of microns, which is consistent with either relatively small extra dimensions or a strongly warped geometry that hides other branes’ influence except for the large-scale manifestation as dark matter.

- **Multiplicity of Branes:** If there are indeed an **infinite number of other universes**, why stop at dark matter? One might wonder if contributions from an infinite stack would also affect the cosmological constant or other aspects. In practice, any infinite sum of influences would need to converge or be regulated by the bulk geometry. Some brane-world models (like certain solutions of Randall–Sundrum) effectively localize gravity near our brane so that distant branes have negligible effect. In those cases, perhaps only a few nearest "pancakes" matter appreciably for dark matter. The *opposite* scenario is also conceivable: maybe only one neighboring brane exists (or a few), not an infinite continuum. Then the dark matter fraction might be explained by, say, one parallel universe that has, for some reason, a comparable matter density to ours. Such a two-brane model resembles the so-called “shadow world” or “mirror matter” scenario that has been discussed in literature (where a hidden mirror sector could constitute dark matter, interacting only via gravity). Our analysis would mostly carry over to that case. The **infinite stack** is a colorful metaphor, but the physics might not require an actually infinite number – just enough mass in other branes to explain observations.

- **Cosmological Initial Conditions:** In $\Lambda$CDM, the dark matter and baryons have specific initial conditions (e.g. almost scale-invariant primordial fluctuations seeded during inflation). If there are multiple branes, do they share a common origin? One might speculate that an early inflationary epoch in the bulk could imprint correlated fluctuations on all branes, or perhaps each brane had its own inflation. If the latter, it would be a coincidence for them to have very similar fluctuation spectra needed to form corresponding structures. Some authors have posited mechanisms like bulk scalars that couple to all branes, causing them to have similar densities or expansion histories. This is an area requiring more theoretical development. Without such an assumption, it could be that not all branes develop structure in sync, and then their contribution to our structure might be different in shape. However, observationally, our dark matter distribution seems closely tied to our baryon distribution (in the sense that we see galaxies and we infer dark matter around them, not randomly elsewhere), suggesting a degree of coordination that the brane picture naturally has if each brane's mass clumps around the same locations due to mutual gravity.

- **Avoiding Double Counting**: If each brane's matter gravitates with others, one must be careful in the equations of motion. Essentially, each brane experiences the gravitational field from the combined mass of all branes. This means if one were writing Einstein's equations in the 5D bulk, one would have stress-energy distributed on several branes and one would solve for the metric. This is more complex than a single brane scenario but tractable in linear theory. In practice, one can think of an effective 4D theory where the presence of other branes is encoded as a specific form of stress-energy (e.g., a fluid with an unusual equation of state in our 4D world that mimics the higher-dimensional effects ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=the%20conclusion%20that%20matter%20on,be%20able%20to%20provide%20the)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=cast%20on%20our%20brane%20by,distribution%20yielded%20by%20hidden%20ordinary))). Liu (2004) showed that the shadow matter from other branes could be modeled as a perfect fluid with an effective density and pressure in our brane, neither cold nor hot dark matter in the usual sense (since it had an $ω = p/\rho$ that was position-dependent and not zero) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=the%20conclusion%20that%20matter%20on,be%20able%20to%20provide%20the)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=cast%20on%20our%20brane%20by,dimensional%20universe%20contains)). Fortunately, on large scales (galactic and beyond), pressureless behavior is acceptable; the pressure terms might only be relevant cosmologically. This indicates that the **effective theory may differ slightly from vanilla CDM**, though not in a way obviously ruled out. Current observations allow dark matter to have a tiny pressure or sound speed as long as it's very close to zero.

- **Connection to Dark Energy:** Some brane-world scenarios link dark matter and dark energy. In the “dark D-brane” model, the motion of a brane gives rise to a scalar field that acts like quintessence (dark energy) while matter on that brane is dark matter ([[2007.15414] Dark D-Brane Cosmology: from background evolution to cosmological perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15414#:~:text=,in%20which%20the%20coupling%20is)) ([[2007.15414] Dark D-Brane Cosmology: from background evolution to cosmological perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15414#:~:text=construction%2C%20dark%20matter%20interacts%20only,via%7D%20a%20disformal%20coupling.%20We)). In our multi-brane picture, one could ask if having many branes or a changing bulk spacetime could induce an accelerated expansion (a candidate for dark energy). The Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) brane model, for instance, modifies gravity at cosmological distances and can mimic accelerated expansion without a cosmological constant. It is beyond our scope to delve deeply into dark energy, but it is enticing that brane constructions might address both dark components of the universe in one framework. Our focus remains on dark matter; however, any comprehensive higher-dimensional theory would ultimately need to account for why our Universe also has dark energy (~68% of the energy density) in addition to this inter-brane dark matter. It could be that the inter-brane interactions or the bulk geometry automatically produce something like dark energy (e.g. the influence of an infinite continuum of branes might act like a cosmological constant term on each brane). This remains speculative.

### Comparison with Established Dark Matter Paradigms  
It is instructive to compare the "reality pancakes" brane-world dark matter hypothesis with the more traditional explanations (WIMPs, axions) and with modified gravity. The following points summarize the key similarities and differences:

- **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles):** These are hypothetical particles (such as supersymmetric neutralinos) that reside in our universe, were thermally produced in the early universe, and cluster under gravity. In both the WIMP paradigm and the brane-world scenario, dark matter is **collisionless and pressureless** on large scales, forming halos that explain galaxy dynamics. The crucial difference lies in detectability and origin. WIMPs should occasionally interact with normal matter via the weak force – for instance, scatters off atomic nuclei or annihilation producing high-energy photons – which gives experimental handles (direct and indirect detection searches). Decades of searches have yet to confirm any signal, placing stringent limits on WIMP interaction cross-sections ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=,Cacciapaglia%20said)). The brane-world dark matter has a built-in reason for evading these searches: it simply does not exist in our particle realm at all, so it *cannot* scatter or annihilate in our detectors. While this makes it harder to ever confirm, it also neatly avoids the growing tension of "Where are the WIMPs?". On the theoretical side, WIMPs require extending the Standard Model (e.g. via supersymmetry or extra dimensions in a different way like universal extra dimensions), whereas the brane scenario requires extending the cosmological model to a higher-dimensional one. Both are speculative in their own way: WIMPs introduce new fundamental particles, brane-world DM introduces new universes. An advantage of WIMPs is that they emerge naturally from some well-motivated theories (susy) and can have the correct relic abundance ("WIMP miracle"), whereas the brane scenario does not yet have a unique underlying theory compelling it – it’s more a potential implication of string theory setups.

- **Axions and Other Light Candidates:** Axions as dark matter are extremely light ($10^{-5}$–$10^{-3}$ eV range) and form a cold Bose-Einstein condensate or classical field oscillation. They interact only via very weak couplings to photons or nucleons, far below detectable levels so far. In many respects, axion dark matter and brane-world dark matter share a similarity: **they both would mainly manifest gravitationally**. Axions at least have some non-gravitational couplings (e.g. ADMX haloscopes are looking for axion-photon conversion in a magnetic field), whereas hidden brane matter has none in our world. If upcoming axion searches continue to find nothing, the hidden matter idea remains viable. One difference is that axions (or "fuzzy dark matter" if ultra-light) can have distinctive effects on small-scale structure (suppressing small halos due to quantum pressure), whereas brane DM behaves like classical matter – presumably it can form small clumps just like normal matter would (down to whatever scale normal matter fragments; potentially limited by if those other branes have their own form of feedback). So small galaxies and subhalo abundances might differ between the scenarios, offering a possible test if discrepancies are found in $\Lambda$CDM predictions vs observations. In summary, both axions and brane DM are so weakly interacting that they are very hard to confirm except through astrophysical inference, but axions come from a well-defined particle physics context, whereas brane DM comes from a quantum gravity/cosmology context.

- **Modified Gravity (MOND and others):** Unlike the particle scenarios, MOND posits no new matter, only a change in the law of gravity. MOND successfully explains many spiral galaxy rotation curves with a single parameter (the acceleration scale $a_0$), which some see as a clue that it’s more than coincidence. However, MOND and its relativistic extensions (like Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity or emergent gravity) struggle with explaining galaxy clusters and cosmology. The **brane-world dark matter** approach, by contrast, keeps the ordinary law of gravity (General Relativity) intact and **adds invisible mass**, so it does not suffer the cluster problem – hidden mass clusters in clusters just as needed – and it can fit into the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework rather than having to overhaul it. In a sense, the brane scenario is closer to the spirit of particle dark matter (undetectable mass) than to MOND. However, it shares with MOND the philosophy of trying to explain dark matter without a new particle in *our* universe – MOND says no new particle at all, brane-world says new particles but in another universe. One notable difference is that MOND is highly predictive and falsifiable (it makes specific quantitative modifications to gravity that can be tested in detailed galaxy analyses, and it has indeed been both successful and challenged in various cases), whereas the brane scenario has enough freedom (number of branes, their matter content, distance, etc.) that it could be adjusted to fit many outcomes, making it harder to conclusively falsify without a direct detection. A commonality is that **both MOND and brane-world ideas are motivated by noticing something odd about gravity** – MOND focuses on the unexplained weakness of gravity at low accelerations, while brane-world focuses on the unexplained weakness of gravity overall (hierarchy problem) and exploits extra dimensions to address it. In some brane models, the leakage of gravity can even produce MOND-like effects in a certain regime (for instance, some higher-dimensional setups might mimic a $1/r$ force at certain scales). But by and large, our scenario does not modify gravity’s form on observable scales; it only adds sources.

- **Other Exotic Models:** There are other ideas, such as “mirror matter” (an exact mirror copy of the Standard Model with particles that do not interact with ours except gravitationally), or “sterile neutrinos” (which would be a new particle but almost only gravitationally coupled). **Mirror matter** is effectively the brane scenario without the geometric interpretation: one could imagine a mirror sector in the same space as us, with its own atoms, stars, etc., that somehow doesn't mix with ours. This is isomorphic if you will to putting those atoms on another brane – mathematically one can formulate it either way. The mirror matter idea has been used to explain puzzling observations like anomalous neutron decay results or dark matter distribution in some dwarf galaxies, but it requires a mechanism to keep the sectors separate (which branes provide naturally). **Sterile neutrinos**, if around  keV in mass, could be dark matter that also hardly interacts, but they typically have some slight mixing with active neutrinos which means X-ray decay lines might be visible (one claimed 3.5 keV X-ray line might be from sterile neutrino decay, though it’s debated). The brane scenario would not produce such a line, which could be a way to distinguish if a firm signal of decaying dark matter is found. **Massive gravitons** in extra-dimensional theories (like Kaluza-Klein gravitons) have also been proposed as dark matter candidates ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=In%20the%20team%27s%20theory%2C%20when,our%20Universe%20as%20massive%20gravitons)) ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=,Cacciapaglia%20said)). Those arise from the same underlying paradigm (extra dimensions); interestingly, if a massive graviton is stable and only gravitationally coupled, it is much like having another brane’s matter except in the bulk field form. Cacciapaglia et al. (2021) argued that gravity propagating in extra dimensions would appear in our 4D universe as a spectrum of massive gravitons that interact only gravitationally – they found that under the right conditions, enough of these could be produced in the early universe to constitute all of dark matter ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=,particles%20in%20the%20early%20Universe)) ([New Theory Suggests That Dark Matter Could Be an Extra-Dimensional Cosmic Refugee : ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-suggests-that-dark-matter-could-be-an-extra-dimensional-cosmic-refugee#:~:text=In%20the%20team%27s%20theory%2C%20when,our%20Universe%20as%20massive%20gravitons)). This is a more *particle-like* exploitation of the same idea (you get "dark matter particles" that are just excitations of gravity), whereas our focus is on *macroscopic matter in other branes*.

In Table 1 below, we summarize some of these comparisons qualitatively:

From the above, one can see that our brane-world dark matter proposal most closely **mimics the particle dark matter paradigm in outcomes**, while sharing some philosophical kinship with modified gravity in that it tries to explain the phenomenon without literally adding a new kind of particle to our universe (the new "stuff" lives elsewhere). Its primary weakness as a proposal is the difficulty of obtaining direct evidence for it; its primary strength is that it can naturally dovetail with existing high-dimensional theories and with the observational successes of $\Lambda$CDM.

## Conclusion  
In this paper, we have examined the speculative proposition that **dark matter is actually the gravitational influence of ordinary matter in parallel universes (or branes)** – whimsically phrased as “mass from adjacent pancakes in an infinite stack of reality pancakes.” We interpreted this idea through the lens of brane cosmology and multiverse frameworks, drawing on recent theoretical research to assess its plausibility. The concept fits into established physics as follows: in theories with extra dimensions (inspired by string theory/M-theory), our Universe may be a 3+1D brane embedded in a higher-dimensional bulk, and multiple branes can exist in the bulk. Standard Model forces are confined to each brane, but gravity propagates in the bulk, allowing matter on different branes to interact gravitationally ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=The%20central%20idea%20is%20that,in%20more%20standard%20cosmological%20models)) ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)). If such a picture is correct, an obvious consequence is that **matter on other branes would be invisible yet gravitating – a natural dark matter candidate** ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=although%20one%20can%20not%20see,implying%20that)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=omega%20is%20a%20positive%20r,and%20implications%20are%20also%20discussed)).

We discussed how this idea is *largely consistent with current observations*: it preserves the successful predictions of cold dark matter at galactic and cosmological scales (flat rotation curves, gravitational lensing in clusters, large-scale structure formation) because hidden-brane matter behaves as collisionless, non-relativistic matter. The scenario even provides a ready explanation for phenomena like the Bullet Cluster that are problematic for modified gravity – the dark mass is simply on another brane and hence does not interact with ordinary gas during collisions, matching the observed separation ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=collision,matter%20in%20the%20cluster%2C%20is)) ([NASA SVS | Chandra and the Bullet Cluster](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094#:~:text=the%20distant%20objects%20is%20distorted,except%20through%20gravity%2C%20and%20separates)). In effect, the brane-world picture **gives a geometric interpretation to dark matter**: what appears as mysterious mass in our 4D world could be ordinary mass displaced in an extra dimension.

We also compared this hypothesis with mainstream dark matter candidates (WIMPs, axions) and found that while it avoids the issue of undetected particles (by positing no detectable interactions at all), it then lacks the near-term testability that those candidates offer. Unlike a 100 GeV WIMP which one might hope to produce or detect in the lab, hidden brane matter can only be probed through gravitational phenomena. This makes the theory challenging to verify. Possible ways to bolster or refute it would include: finding evidence of extra dimensions or branes through high-precision gravitational experiments; detecting any cross-brane particle oscillations (as speculative neutron experiments attempt ([Sketch of the model proposed with two branes: A visible brane and a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-of-the-model-proposed-with-two-branes-A-visible-brane-and-a-hidden-brane-The_fig1_48202052#:~:text=Can%20neutron%20disappearance%2Freappearance%20experiments%20definitively,copy%20of%20the%20Standard%20Model))); or conversely, finally discovering a dark matter particle in our universe (which would not necessarily *disprove* the brane idea, but would remove the primary motivation for it). If future collider or direct detection experiments were to discover a WIMP or axion, the impetus for explaining dark matter via other universes would wane, though one could still have a scenario where both normal dark matter and some inter-brane effect coexist. On the other hand, if decades go by with no dark matter particle found and modified gravity also fails to account for all data, then more attention may turn to these extra-dimensional explanations.

We emphasize which parts of our discussion are established science and which are speculative. **Established:**
- The existence of dark matter is well-supported by multiple independent observations ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=,sigma)) ([[astro-ph/0608407] A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608407#:~:text=significance%20spatial%20offset%20of%20the,in%20the%20system%20is%20unseen)).
- Brane-world models are a serious area of research in theoretical physics, with concrete formulations (e.g. Randall–Sundrum, DGP) that solve real problems and have testable consequences ([Brane cosmology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology#:~:text=Some%20versions%20of%20brane%20cosmology%2C,Various)).
- Gravity coupling to extra dimensions can, in principle, allow unseen matter to influence visible matter ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=one%20side%20of%20the%20circle,fluid%20could%20serve%20as%20a)) ([[hep-ph/0312200] Compactified Newtonian Potential and a Possible Explanation for Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312200#:~:text=cast%20on%20our%20brane%20by,distribution%20yielded%20by%20hidden%20ordinary)). This is shown in simplified models and does not violate any known physics.

**Speculative:**
- The idea that *our* dark matter is entirely due to such hidden matter is speculative; it is not part of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and has not been empirically demonstrated.
- The "infinite stack of pancakes" is a metaphorical extreme – whether an infinite number of parallel universes exist is unknown, and current physics does not require it. A finite (perhaps small) number of branes could suffice for the effect, but even their existence is unproven.
- We assumed a relatively symmetric situation (other branes have similar matter content). If the other branes were very different, the outcome might not neatly explain dark matter in our universe; we glossed over how or why the multiverse might be set up that way, as that delves into deeper theories of initial conditions (inflationary multiverse, etc.) which remain conjectural.

In conclusion, **viewing dark matter as an interdimensional effect provides an intriguing alternate paradigm** that intersects cosmology, particle physics, and quantum gravity. It challenges the notion that dark matter must be a new particle species in our universe by instead attributing it to a richer structure of spacetime – a true cosmological hidden sector that is not just hidden in a collider, but hidden behind a dimensional veil. This idea does not currently replace the $\Lambda$CDM model, but it complements it in that it could produce a phenomenologically identical scenario (dark matter halos, structure formation, etc.) from a very different underlying cause. As our experimental searches for dark matter particles and our gravitational tests of fundamental laws continue to advance, we may find hints that guide us toward or away from this concept. Until then, the reality-pancake hypothesis remains a compelling thought experiment grounded in theoretical possibilities. It reminds us that the universe could be more expansive and connected in unseen ways than our conventional 4D perception suggests – and that the true nature of dark matter might lie not in an exotic particle, but in the unseen masses of worlds next door.
